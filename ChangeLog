0.56.3
------
1. Don't set sliders to flat just because appearance is flat.

0.56.2
------
1. Use case-insesitive string compares when checking Qt and KDE config files.

------
1. Fix crash when using corner default button indicator and no coloured
   mouse over.

        Frameless groupboxes
        Gradient KDE4 window titlebars
2. Correctly position corner indicator.
3. Use mouse over colours for corner indicator.

 5. 'Fix' for plasma and NVIDIA cards (on my system at least). Buttons,
    scrollbars, etc., in plasma's dialogs have redraw errors on NVIDIA
    (but not on my works integrated intel chip). So, by default gradients
    on plasma widgets (of the Qt variety) are drawn directly, and not cached
    to pixmaps. To revert to the previous method, edit
     $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/qtcurvestylerc (e.g. ~/.config/qtcurvestylerc)

    ...and add

     plasmaHack=false
 6. Dont do mouse over for dockwidget title area.

------
1. Supply a simple 'mkpkg' script to create packages with checkinstall.
2. Fix drawing of menubar on KDE4's konqueror.

   colour as highlight for inactive windows/elements.
3. Set KDE4 colours from Q3 settings if running under KDE3.
4. Fix for KDE4's setting of inactive palette!=active palette
   (Left highlight and highlightedText as configurable)
5. Use 'highlightedText' for highlighted part of progressbar label.
6. Increase height of spinboxes.
7. Alter KTitleWidget (again!)
8. Add gui to set shading option.
9. Nicer look for selected tab highlight.

0.53

 1. Removed 'Shadow buttons' option, and replaced with none/shadow/etch setting

2. Lighten trough of disabled slider.
3. Store no etch widgets in a set, to speed up checking.
4. When building for Qt4 only, you *must* build from within
   the qt4 folder. This is due to the different ways qmake
   and cmake create moc files.

------
1. Fix crash when slider colour == button.

0.52.1
------
1. Draw emphasis around menus when not lightening.

5. Disable etch/shadow for plasma and khtml widgets.

                       of scrollviews.
        gtkComboMenus  set to 'true' so that non-editable behave as per Gtk,
                       draw up and down arrow as per Gtk, and combo list uses
                       menu colour for background.
 9. Style KTitleWidget
10. Fix combo boxes in listviews.
11. Fix crash in designer when 'Fix parentless dialogs' is enabled.

15. Make spinbutton height more consistent with KDE3.

    editing $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/qtcurvestylerc and setting 'shading=simple'
    for the previous method, or 'shading=hsv' to use HSV.
