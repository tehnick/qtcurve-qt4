Installation
------------
To build and install:

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. make install


If you have KDE4 installed, then cmake will detect this, and compile QtCurve's config dialog.


Creating Distribution Packages
------------------------------

CMake (as of v2.4.x) does not support building rpm or deb packages, and a simple
checkinstall will not work. CMake 2.6 should support rpm and deb packages, but until
then I have supplied a simple shell script to build a package with checkinstall.
To use this:

1. Install QtCurve as described above
2. From within the 'build' folder from step 2 above, call ../common/mkpkg
3. Answer the checkinstall questions.
